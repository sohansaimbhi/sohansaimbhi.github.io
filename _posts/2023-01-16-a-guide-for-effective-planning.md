I am sure all of us have been through days where we think we can complete everything as per schedule and at the end we finally just realize that our whole planning was not right, and we repeat the same process the next day and again end up nowhere.

That's the reason I thought of coming up with a few tips which I have learnt over the years and the ones that actually helped me change the way I planned things resulting in me being more productive.

I'm sure you will benefit from it as well :)

Here are a few tips for planning your day and completing tasks on time:

Create a schedule: Set aside specific times of the day for studying and completing homework. This will help you stay on track and avoid procrastination.
Prioritize tasks: Make a list of all your tasks and prioritize them based on importance and deadline. Tackle the most important or urgent tasks first.
Break down large tasks: Large assignments or projects can be overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, manageable tasks and set deadlines for each of them.
Use a planner or calendar: Use a planner or calendar to keep track of deadlines and appointments. This will help you stay organized and on top of your responsibilities. ( I would personally recommend Trello or Google Calendar)
Avoid multitasking: It's tempting to try to do multiple things at once, but multitasking can actually decrease productivity. Focus on one task at a time and give it your full attention.
Take breaks: Taking short breaks throughout the day can help to refresh your mind and improve focus.
Eliminate distractions: Identify and eliminate any distractions, such as social media, that may be preventing you from completing your work efficiently.
Review and Reflect: before going to bed review what you accomplished during the day, Reflect on what went well and what you could do better in the next day.
By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can become more organized, focused and be able to complete your homework on time. Remember, consistency is key, try to stick to your plan as much as possible and adjust it if necessary.

Thanks :)

Let me know if it helped in any way :)
